       "'In my experience, giving difficult feedback, especially when it relates to sales targets, can be quite challenging. In one instance, I had a team member who was struggling to meet their sales targets. My approach was to first ensure I had a clear understanding of their performance metrics and the areas where they were underperforming. I prepared thoroughly by reviewing their sales numbers, pipeline status, and any client feedback available.\\n\\nDuring the feedback session, I focused on the data and facts, which aligns with my task-oriented management style. I emphasized the importance of meeting our key performance indicators and offered specific examples of where improvements could be made. While I strive to be direct and clear, I sometimes find that my communication style can come across as abrasive, which I am actively working on.\\n\\nThe outcome was mixed. Initially, the feedback was not well-received, and the team member felt somewhat defensive. However, by the end of our discussion, I was able to convey the critical need for improvement and the steps they could take to enhance their performance. We agreed on a follow-up plan and set measurable goals for improvement. Although I continue to work on my interpersonal skills, this experience reinforced the need for clear communication and measurable objectives in performance management.'"
